		<h2>Building QHook</h2>
		<p>Before we can use QHook, we need to build it into a static library. So to start, let's make a directory to store the library and include files.<br/>
		Create a folder in the root of your drive called 'libs' and within that a folder called 'QHook' (C:\libs\QHook). This is where we will store<br/>
		the library and include files. Now navigate back to the QHook project directory, copy the 'include' folder, and paste it into the new QHook lib directory<br/>
		(C:\libs\QHook). Now we can start building! Below are the guides to building and linking with MSVC</p>
		<h3>MSVC Build And Link Guide</h3>
		<p>Open the project into Qt Creator, configure a build kit for it, and build it as release. Now navigate to the build directory<br/>and move the 'QHook.lib' into the QHook library directory (C:\libs\QHook\lib).</p>

		<p>Create a new Qt Project (or use your current one) and let's setup the project file. Go ahead and open your .pro file, and we are now going<br/>
		to link the QHook library into the project. This is my project file...</p>

		<div class="code-block" style="width:500px;">
			<span class="g">QT</span> += core gui<br/>
			<br/>
			<span class="g">TARGET</span> = HookTest<br/>
			<span class="g">TEMPLATE</span> = app<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<span class="g">SOURCES</span> += main.cpp
		</div>

		<p>First we need to link the include path, which we can do with...</p>
		<div class="code-block" style="width:500px;">
			<span class="g">INCLUDEPATH</span> += C:/libs/QHook/include
		</div>
		<p>Next, we need to link QHook.lib... which is done like so...</p>
		<div class="code-block" style="width:500px;">
			<span class="g">LIBS</span> += -lC:/libs/QHook/libs/QHook 
		</div>

		<p>QHook is now linked into the projet. However, there is one bug that I seem to always get when using the Windows API which will result in a lot of unresolved symbol errors. So to fix this, we need to link one more library, which is a standard library in Windows...</p>

		<div class="code-block" style="width:500px;">
			<span class="g">LIBS</span> += -luser32
		</div>

		<p>So your final project file should look something like this...</p>

		<div class="code-block" style="width:500px;">
			<span class="g">QT</span> += core gui<br/>
			<br/>
			<span class="g">TARGET</span> = HookTest<br/>
			<span class="g">TEMPLATE</span> = app<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<span class="g">INCLUDEPATH</span> += C:/libs/QHook/include<br/>
			<br/>
			<span class="g">LIBS</span> += -lC:/libs/QHook/lib/QHook<br/>
			<span class="g">LIBS</span> += -luser32<br/>
			<br/>
			<span class="g">SOURCES</span> += main.cpp
		</div>

		<p>You're project is now ready to go!</p>
